# Summary

This directory contains all of the hardware dependent code needed to use a STM32 Nucleo-H753ZI
development board with STM32H753ZIT2 MCU.

The `CMSIS` and `STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver` taken from the [STM32CubeH7 v1.11.1](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7)
repository. These directories do not require any modification to get an application up and running.

The `STM_Interface` contains all of the setup and configuration code for the board. This will need
to be modified to select and provide initialisation endpoints for the peripherals. A good starting
point for this is to use the [STM32CubeMX v6.10.0](https://www.st.com/stm32cubemx) which can be
used to generate starting code for the board/chip that you wish to implement.

> Note that the files in the `bsp` directory have been modified from the versions originally
> generated by STM32CubeMX. In particular is important to note that the
> `bsp/STM32H753ZITX_FLASH.ld` and `bsp/startup_stm32h753Zitx.s` have been modified.

The files in the top level directory (`mmhal.c`, `mmport.h`, `wlan_hal.c`) are where the board
specific API functions used by morselib are implemented.
