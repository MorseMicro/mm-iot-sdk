# Summary

This directory contains all of the hardware dependent code needed to use MM6108-EKH05 evaluation
that comes with STM32U585VIT6 chipset.

The `bsp` directory contains all of the setup and configuration code for the board. This will need
to be modified to select and provide initialisation endpoints for the peripherals. A good starting
point for this is to use the [STM32CubeMX v6.11.0](https://www.st.com/stm32cubemx) which can be
used to generate starting code for the board/chip that you wish to implement.

> Note that the files in the `bsp` directory have been modified from the versions originally
> generated by STM32CubeMX. In particular is important to note that the
> `bsp/STM32U585XX_FLASH.ld` and `bsp/startup_stm32u585VIT6.s` have been modified.

The files in the `mm_shims` directory (e.g., `mmhal.c`, `mmport.h`, `wlan_hal.c`) are where the
board-specific API functions used by morselib and other software components are implemented.

## Pinout STM32 to HaLow Module
To use the SDIO interface, please make sure that the SDIO jumper resistors are soldered and SPI
jumper resistors are removed. Also, ensure that you have pull ups on the SDIO CLK and CMD lines.
